# Iskra-Delta-Partner-ROM
Dumps and disassembly of Iskra Delta Partner ROMS, Slovenian computer from the 80'

# OS ROMs
This folder contains three different OS ROMS, for 1FG, WFG models of the computer and one, that has altered boot screen.

# unknown ROMs
This folder contains presumably the character ROMS, but this is still unconfirmed if you know more about it please let me know.

OS ROMs have also been dissasembled and the code has been commented (in slovene).
